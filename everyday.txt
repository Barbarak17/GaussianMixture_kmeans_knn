Looks like we're out of time! That was such an informative
RT @tlc4070: @EverydayHealth #healthtalk check menus online before going. Nutritional info can be found restaurant websites w/cal, fat , sodium,
Interesting! RT @cspi: A9 Buffalo Wild Wings and Applebee's both had some pretty extreme dishes.
RT @iPura: Seems as if restaurants could reduce portion sizes by 10% without consumers noticing or caring - reduce waste, increase profits
Q9: Any runners up that didn't make it into #XtremeEating?
Cool! RT @joyofnutrition: If u have kids check out @KidsLiveWell which provides healthier options 4 kids. Download the app too!
RT @FitAndFabLiving: @everydayhealth Drink water (not pop or alcohol), get dressings on the side and skip the appetizers and dessert
RT @CSPI: A8 Sugary drinks should be consumed only as an occasional treat. Look what happened to #TheRealBears 
RT @CSPI: A8 No foods need to be off limits, but take care to consume only a small portion of really high calorie foods, infrequently.
Anyone have any questions for @CSPI? Ask now!
RT @ChristysChomp: #healthtalk A7: I say, save the calories for the food! Don't waste them on sugary drinks (sodas, sweet teas, creamy/sweet coffee,
RT @Robinsbite: A7: And, beware the chip/bread/cracker basket. Here in Texas, chips can be the death of people when dining out!
RT @Robinsbite: @CSPI A7: as my 3 yr old says "save this for later" when talking about to-go containers! Smart kid!
RT @LocateSpecDiet: @everydayhealth A8: #healthtalk Anything fried and anything doused in cream
Say 'ahh' for relief! A new study finds that mindfulness meditation techniques may help relieve inflammation:
RT @CSPI: .@HopeJahren Americans consume over one third of calories outside the home, so it's really not a matter of "once in a while."
Q8: Are there certain foods we should avoid entirely while eating out?
RT @joyofnutrition: A7: Plan ahead and share a meal. 1/2 portions, small plates are a big trend in restaurants.
RT @ChristysChomp: @EverydayHealth #healthtalk Fill up on the veggies! Avoid fried meat/fish. Large portion? Pack 1/2 to-go b4 starting ur
RT @CSPI: A7 So to watch calories while dining out, skip the apps and desserts, and split entrees or take some home.
RT @ChangeYourScale: @EverydayHealth Q7: If you can, split a meal. If not, get a to-go box right away, so you're not tempted to clean your plate.
Yes! RT @angqueenie: Q7: What are your tips for healthy eating while dining out? #HealthTalk" salad dressing on the side
RT @HopeJahren: Is it true that Xtreme Eating once in a while won't hurt you? If so, how frequently is too frequently?
Fiber-rich foods to add to your diet ASAP:
RT @CSPI: A7 A good rule is to assume apps, entrees, and desserts each have around 1,000 calories.
Good advice! RT @eatteachblog: @EverydayHealth - Check out the menu before you head over! :)
Thx! RT @joyofnutrition: A6: Check out @DineOutHealthy which provides calorie info on menu items from restaurants nationwide
Q7: What are your tips for healthy eating while dining out?
RT @CSPI: A6 Until calorie labeling rules come out, you might not be able to. But some chains have nutrition info online.
RT @CSPI: All chain restaurants with 20+ locations will be required to list calories on menus &amp; menu boards according to those rules.
RT @CSPI: .@MPHSamBader They aren't currently, but calorie labeling regulations are coming out soon from FDA.
Q6: How can we get nutritional info on the dishes served at restaurants?
RT @CSPI: A5 The Bistro Shrimp Pasta at @cheesecake would be more appropriate for 4 people.
Yikes! RT @cspi: A5 Most unhealthy dish we found is Bistro Shrimp Pasta from @Cheesecake Factory: 3,120 cals, 89 grams sat fat

Your Genetic Secrets May Not Be as Safe as You Think
Q5: As a registered dietician, which Xtreme Eating dish would you say is the most unhealthy?
RT @CSPI: A4 IMO, restaurants know all customers want a bargain. A bigger portion seems like you're getting more bang for your buck.
RT @ChristysChomp: A4: It's the whole "get the most for my $" frame of mind, I believe. Quantity over quality.
Hello! Welcome! RT @christyschomp: #HealthTalk hello! How you don't mind me jumping
RT @powerscooters: @AdvocateSH avoid fried foods, ask how big portions are, &amp; don't be afraid to take food home or split a meal
RT @RunningChances: A4: because people have this idea that they need a large amount of food for the money but forget quality&gt;quantity
RT @CSPI: .@AdvocateSH @everydayhealth If they offer a lower-calorie menu, order from that! It's the only guarantee to get fewer calories.
Q4: Why do restaurants serve extremely large portions, like those in #XtremeEating?
RT @CSPI: A3 The portion is huge - over a pound of chicken! 3/4 pounds mashed potatoes, full of butter &amp; cream. It's unnecessary!
WOW! RT @cspi: A3 @Cheesecake's Chicken Costoletta - chicken breast, mashed potatoes, &amp; asparagus add up to 2610 calories??
RT @CSPI: A3 @Cheesecake's Chicken Costoletta surprised me most - chicken breast, mashed potatoes, &amp; asparagus add up to 2610 calories??
Q3: Which #XtremeEating dish surprised you the most with its calorie/sat fat/sodium info?
RT @CSPI: .@hayliejustinepo @everydayhealth But menus are still mostly made up of high calorie options.
RT @CSPI: .@hayliejustinepo @everydayhealth Both. A lot of restaurants are making a few healthy options available,
RT @CSPI: A2 All the calorie, sat fat, &amp; sodium info was provided by the restaurants themselves, which do their own nutrition analysis.
@hayliejustinepo great question!
RT @hayliepomroy: @CPSI In your opinion, are chain restaurants getting better or worse for healthy options? @everydayhealth
RT @CSPI: .@hayliejustinepo We don't know how popular these items are, but we chose dishes from the most popular restaurant chains.
