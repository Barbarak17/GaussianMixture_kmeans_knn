That's a wrap. Thanks to @cprwhitney @afrakt @cpearsonavalere @jrovner @jneel @dickknox and all of you!
When will see what some of the plans are going to sell?
Any predictions on where the states will land on this?
We've got about 5 min. more. Get your last questions/comments in.
Is @mfcannon there? If not, we think he might ask if federal exchanges are able to legally provide subsidies. @jrovner?
What will we know by the end of the day tomorrow as far as where states stand? And what has to happen then?
How much of insurance shopping through exchanges will be online? And how much will be in person?
Will the rollout of these exchanges go any better than the one for the Medicare drug benefit? @afrakt? Anybody?
So what will these marketplaces be selling? Have states decided on the essential health benefits benchmark plans?
Hey, @dickknox and @afrakt, how's the exchange in Mass. working? Doesn't that give us a hint of things to come nationally?
Q: What does it mean for consumers if states run their own exchanges or rely on federal government?
What's at stake for the states? Why wouldn't they want to do one on their own?
Hi! Thanks for coming to our chat about health exchanges. Here we go!
